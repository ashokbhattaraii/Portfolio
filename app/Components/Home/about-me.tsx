            in web development with expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
            MySQL. I hold certifications in Responsive Web Design and JavaScript
            Algorithms and Data Structures, and I'm currently working as a QA
            Intern at Rumsan, where I'm gaining hands-on experience in quality
            assurance and blockchain technology. I'm driven by a passion for
            creating responsive, user-friendly applications and ensuring
            software quality. My approach combines technical skills with
            attention to detail and a commitment to continuous learning. Whether
            it's building clean interfaces or identifying edge cases in testing,
            I strive to deliver work that meets the highest standards. I'm
            always excited to take on new challenges and contribute to
            meaningful projects that make a positive impact.
